Create an Interactive Dashboard
For this exercise, we want you to combine the two charts from the Tableau Interactivity Practice Workbook into a dashboard and add the interactive elements described below. At the end of this reading, you can find a video demonstrating how these interactive elements should function in your completed dashboard.

To get started, open a new dashboard canvas in your Tableau Interactivity Practice Workbook and combine the two given charts into a dashboard. When combining the charts in your dashboard, consider what you’ve learned about good dashboard design principles. Is the placement of the charts in your dashboard well organized and well balanced (with appropriate amounts of white space)? Once you are satisfied with the layout of your dashboard, build the following four interactive elements into it:

1​. Set the % of Mobile Usage by Operating System chart as a “master filter” over other charts.
For the first interactive element in your dashboard, make the % of Mobile Usage by Operating System chart (i.e., the pie chart) function as a “master filter” over the other charts in the dashboard. This means that, when you select a slice in the pie chart, the Operating System represented by that slice will also be isolated in the line graph and the dashboard legend. Note: you may need to edit the axes of your line chart to remain “fixed” when filtered. Otherwise, the range of your y-axis may change relative to the Operating System being isolated and, therefore, may distort the context of that data.

2​. Make the OS Usages Over Time chart function as a “highlighter” for other charts.
For the second interactive element in your dashboard, make the OS Usages Over Time chart (the line graph) function as a “highlighter” for the other charts in the dashboard. This means that, when you select a line in the line graph, the Operating System represented by that line will also be highlighted in the pie chart and the dashboard legend.

3​. Make the “Mobile Operating System” legend function as a “highlighter” for charts.
Current versions of Tableau have a highlighter icon in the upper-right corner of legends, which can be toggled to turn on the legend’s highlighting feature. For the third interactive element in your dashboard, make the “Mobile Operating System” legend function as a “highlighter” for the charts in the dashboard. This means that, when you select an Operating System from those listed in the dashboard legend, that Operating System will also be highlighted in the pie chart and the line graph.

4​. Create a Date filter for the % of Mobile Usage by Operating System chart.
For the last interactive element in your dashboard, create a new filter for the % of Mobile Usage by Operating System chart (the pie chart) that allows you to select data for a specific date. This filter will apply only to the pie chart and will give users the ability to show a pie chart for OS usage on a specific date, rather than usage over all dates recorded. Your new Date filter should also have the following characteristics:

Set the filter to appear as a single-value dropdown menu.

Edit the title of your filter so that it is clear what the filter does.

“Float” your Date filter and place it appropriately within your dashboard (keeping in mind what you’ve learned about good dashboard design principles).

After you have added these interactive elements to your dashboard, it is also a good idea to edit the title of your pie chart! This is because the view presented in your % of Mobile Usage by Operating System chart will change depending on how you use the Date filter that you created for element number 4. Specifically, rather than simply showing the average percentage usage across all dates recorded, your pie chart now has the capability to display percentage usage on a specific date. Re-title your pie chart to indicate this. (See the following video for an example.)
