# Week 1: Getting to Know the Data
This week’s videos and readings were all about descriptive statistics. You learned about measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, frequency tables, scatter plots, and correlation coefficients. These all can be important tools for understanding your marketing data. For this Capstone Week 1 assignment, we want to use these tools to better understand the data in your Capstone Dataset spreadsheet.

When you open the Capstone Dataset spreadsheet you can see that it is a collection of data comparing the performance of two separate ad campaigns: a Facebook Ad campaign (in the blue colored columns of the sheet) and an AdWords Ad campaign (in the green colored columns). The data is collected for every day of the year 2019, so you have 365 lines of campaign data to analyze! Ultimately, we want to determine whether one of these ad campaigns is more effective, in terms of conversions, compared to the other. But before we address that question, we should get a better understanding of the conversion data for each of the campaigns.

To better understand how effective our campaigns are at producing conversions, we’re going to begin by analyzing the relationship between a campaign’s number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions. 
Let’s do this by calculating 
(1.) the measures of central tendency, 
(2.) some measures of dispersion, and 
(3.) the frequency and correlation data for a campaign’s clicks and conversions.

We’ve learned how to do all of these things with our spreadsheet software. Below, we show you the results we get for the Facebook Ad data. We started by creating a new sheet in our Capstone Dataset spreadsheet and copy-and-pasting the “Date,” “Facebook Ad Clicks,” and “Facebook Ad Conversions” data into the first three columns of our new sheet. This makes it easier to work with that specific data for the calculations that follow! 

Note: for your Capstone Week 1 assignment, you are doing these calculations for “AdWords Ad Clicks” and “AdWords Ad Conversions.”
