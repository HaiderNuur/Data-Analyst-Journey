# Week One
### Measures of Central Tendency
- Which of the following is/are measure(s) of central tendency? > Mean, median, mode
- Based on the video, what are measures of central tendency? > They are numbers that represent "middle" of a dataset.
- How might a marketer find value in knowing the middle of a dataset? >it can help assess the impact of marketing efforts, it can provide a reasonable baseline for what to expect from a particular demographic.
- What is the mean of the following set of numbers? -11, 2, -2, 0, 9, 8 > mean is 1
- Which measure of central tendency would be the most reasonable for defining the middle of the dataset below? -2, 4, 1, -1, 3, 73 > Median
- Calculate the median for the following set of numbers. -4, 1, 7, -2, 48, 22, -11 > median is 1
- In a spreadsheet, the following formula will find the mean of the numbers in the cells D2 to D20. AVERAGE(D2:D20 > False
- What is an advantage the median has over the mean? > The median is insensitive to outliers.
- What is the mode for the following set of numbers? 5, 3, -2, 44, 3, 44, 3 > the mode is 3

### Measures of Dispersion
- What is the purpose of a measure of variation? > It provides an indication of how spread out the data is.
- Measures of variation is an alternative name for measures of central tendency. > False
- Which of the following is not a measure of variation? > Mean
- What is the range for the following dataset? -7, 1, -3, -2, 4, -1 > 11
- Suppose that you are given the following data. Would the range be a reasonable measure of the spread in the data? Why or why not? 
2, 1, 5, 10, 6, 45 > No, it is not reasonable because there is an outlier.
- Suppose a dataset has a standard deviation of 4 and a mean of 3. What is the z-score for a data value of 6? > The z-score is 0.75
- For a normal distribution how many data values should you expect to fall within two standard deviations of the mean? > 
- How can a z-score be useful? > I. It can help in determining if a data value is high or low in the population., II. It tells you how many standard deviations from the mean a data value is., III. It can be used to determine data outliers.
- For a normal distribution, how many standard deviations from the mean is a good criterion for determining an outlier? > 3

## Graded quiz
- What is the formula used to find the z-score for a data value? > z = (value â€“ mean)/std.
- What is the formula for finding the mean of a dataset in a spreadsheet? (Assume that the data is in the cells A1 to A100.) > =AVERAGE(A1:A100)
- What is the formula for finding the range of a dataset? > Max val - min val
- What is the mode for the following set of numbers? 26, 11, 45, 0, 7, 7, 0 > the mode is 0 and 7
- In a normal distribution, what percentage of data values are found between the mean and one standard deviations below the mean > 34%
- What is the median for the given dataset? 19, 42, 33, 15, 21 > median is 21
- True or false: The median is preferred for datasets that have outliers > True
- What is the mean of the given set of numbers? 4, 7, 3, 1, 2, 1 > the mean is 3
- What does a measure of variation tell you about a dataset? > I.  How spread out the data is, 
- Which of the following is not how a marketer can use a measure of central tendency. > Predicting customer behavior
