# Week 1: Getting to Know the Data
This week’s videos and readings were all about descriptive statistics. You learned about measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, frequency tables, scatter plots, and correlation coefficients. These all can be important tools for understanding your marketing data. For this Capstone Week 1 assignment, we want to use these tools to better understand the data in your Capstone Dataset spreadsheet.

When you open the Capstone Dataset spreadsheet you can see that it is a collection of data comparing the performance of two separate ad campaigns: a Facebook Ad campaign (in the blue colored columns of the sheet) and an AdWords Ad campaign (in the green colored columns). The data is collected for every day of the year 2019, so you have 365 lines of campaign data to analyze! Ultimately, we want to determine whether one of these ad campaigns is more effective, in terms of conversions, compared to the other. But before we address that question, we should get a better understanding of the conversion data for each of the campaigns.

To better understand how effective our campaigns are at producing conversions, we’re going to begin by analyzing the relationship between a campaign’s number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions. 
Let’s do this by calculating 
(1.) the measures of central tendency, 
(2.) some measures of dispersion, and 
(3.) the frequency and correlation data for a campaign’s clicks and conversions.

We’ve learned how to do all of these things with our spreadsheet software. Below, we show you the results we get for the Facebook Ad data. We started by creating a new sheet in our Capstone Dataset spreadsheet and copy-and-pasting the “Date,” “Facebook Ad Clicks,” and “Facebook Ad Conversions” data into the first three columns of our new sheet. This makes it easier to work with that specific data for the calculations that follow! 

Note: for your Capstone Week 1 assignment, you are doing these calculations for “AdWords Ad Clicks” and “AdWords Ad Conversions.”

# Week 2
## 1. Create Histograms for ‘Clicks’ and ‘Conversions’ Data
A distribution shows the probability of possible outcomes occurring within your dataset.

Distributions are represented by a distribution curve. This week we learned how to visualize the distribution of values by creating histograms. Histograms are a type of bar chart, where each bar represents a value range and the number of data values that fall into that range. We call these ranges “buckets.” The height of each bar in your histogram will be determined by the number of data values that fall into each “bucket.” So, the bars in your histogram just represent the frequency for each value or value range in your chart. Review this week’s reading, “Distribution,” for a refresher on how to create a histogram in Excel and Google Sheets.

In our Capstone Project we have begun to focus on our data for “Clicks” and “Conversions” from each of the ad campaigns (Facebook and AdWords) in our Capstone Dataset. For this first part of our Capstone Week 2 assignment, we want to determine whether our data for “Clicks” and “Conversions” falls under a normal distribution curve. To do this, use your spreadsheet software to create two histograms—one for the “Clicks” data and one for the “Conversions” data.

For your “Clicks” data create a histogram with a bucket size of 10.

For your “Conversions” data create a histogram with a bucket size of 2.

Evaluate your histograms: Do they show a Normal distribution?

In our example below, we show you histograms for the Facebook Ad Clicks and the Facebook Ad Conversions. For your Capstone Week 2 assignment create histograms for AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions, then determine whether they fall under a normal distribution curve. You will cut-and-paste copies of your AdWords Ad histograms into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 2.

## 2. Determine What Variable Types You’re Working With
Place each of these variables:                                                                                                                                                    (1.) AdWords Ad Views,                                                                                                                                                            (2.) AdWords Ad Clicks,                                                                                                                                                           (3.) AdWords Ad Conversions,                                                                                                                                                     (4.) Cost per AdWords Ad,                                                                                                                                                         (5.) AdWords Click-Through Rate,                                                                                                                                                 (6.) AdWords Conversion Rate,                                                                                                                                                     (7.) AdWords Cost per 
Click, into one of the following variable types.
- Quantitative-Continuous
- Quantitative-Discrete
- Qualitative-Nominal
- Qualitative-Ordinal
You will enter your classifications into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 2.

# Week 3
## 1. Formulate a Hypothesis to Answer Your Evaluation Question
Marketing studies begin with an evaluation question. We noted how these evaluation questions come from many sources. Sometimes you get them from your manager as they evaluate business needs. The question may come directly from a stakeholder or client. You may even come up with an evaluation question yourself, when thinking about your marketing efforts and audience, or ways to help your company.

It’s these evaluation questions that motivate us to form hypotheses—proposed answers to the question at hand—that we can then test through our analysis of data.
For this Capstone Week 3 assignment we want you to analyze the Capstone Dataset data with the following evaluation question in hand:

The first task we want you to address this week is to write a hypothesis statement that answers this evaluation question. Recall from our reading, “Experimental Design,” that a good hypothesis addresses three parts:

Three Parts of a Clear Hypothesis:
- What will change?
- How will it change?
- What will cause the change?

You should try to formulate your hypothesis to address these three questions. For example, a good hypothesis for the evaluation question above might say something like: “Our number of conversions will be greater if we advertise on platform X rather than platform Y” (where X and Y are one of the platforms, AdWords or Facebook). This hypothesis answers the evaluation question in a way that addresses the three parts of a clear hypothesis. 

You will enter your hypothesis into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 3.

## 2. Determine Your Independent and Dependent Variables
Once you have formulated your hypothesis, you will need to consider what variables from your dataset are required to test that hypothesis. Recall from the “Experimental Design” reading how, when you conduct an experiment or test, you will typically manipulate one set of variables to see how changes in those variables influence changes measured in some other set of variables. In a test like this, we call the variable that we manipulate an independent variable. The variable whose effect we measure is called a dependent variable. In terms of the parts of a clear hypothesis statement, the dependent variable will be what addresses the question of “what will change;” and the independent variable will be what addresses the question of “what will cause the change.” So, you should be able to infer your independent and dependent variables from the hypothesis you formulated above!

Consider the evaluation question and your hypothesis for this assignment to determine the independent and dependent variables for testing your hypothesis. You will enter these into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 3.

## 3. Test Your Hypothesis
It’s time to test your hypothesis. It is quite clear from the evaluation question you were given that your test will involve a comparison: you were asked to compare Facebook and AdWords Conversion data. This is typical of marketing analytics questions! It is also why we said, in the readings on “Hypothesis Testing and A/B Tests” and “More on Hypothesis Testing,” that hypothesis tests are framed in terms of the question: “Is there a  difference?” 

You learned how this question implies two possible answers, or two hypotheses:


We call the first hypothesis (H0) the null hypothesis. We refer to the second hypothesis (H1) as the alternative hypothesis. Hypothesis tests are designed to determine which of these hypotheses—the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis—is the true one. This is what you need to do for the hypothesis you formulated above. You should begin by getting clear on what the null and alternative hypotheses are for your hypothesis test. (Hint: “population A” and “population B” are just the two things that your evaluation question asked you to compare.)

Here are the things you should do to test your hypothesis:

a​. Calculate the mean values for the “Facebook Ad Conversions” and “AdWords Ad Conversions” data you were given in your Capstone Dataset. (Remember: you can do this in Excel or Google Sheets with the =AVERAGE formula.) This will tell you whether there is any overall difference between “Facebook Ad Conversions” and “AdWords Ad Conversions.”

b. Next, you need to determine whether this overall difference is a statistically significant difference. You learned to do this by comparing the p-value for your data to some given Alpha value (𝛂). For a refresher on this, refer back to the “More on Hypothesis Testing” reading. 

We are giving you an Alpha of 5% (𝛂 = 0.05); but you will need to calculate the p-value for yourself. You can calculate the p-value in an Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheet by applying the t-test formula we gave you in this week’s readings and videos: 


(In the t-test formula, “A:A” refers to the column of “Facebook Ad Conversions” data and “B:B” to the column of “AdWords Ad Conversions.”) If your t-test formula gives you a p-value that is less than 𝛂, then that means the difference between “Facebook Ad Conversions” and “AdWords Ad Conversions” is a statistically significant difference. 

c. Given what you’ve discovered about whether there’s a statistically significant difference in the data, what does this tell you about whether to accept the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis?

d. Finally, putting it all together: What’s your conclusion about your main hypothesis? Is there a difference, and is it what your hypothesis predicted?

You will enter these test results into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 3.

# Week 4
1. Choosing a Model
In  this week’s discussions we looked closely at three common types of models and how to run them using the Tableau software. Those models were: Simple Linear Regression, Cluster Analysis, and Time Series Analysis. We also discussed Classification Analyses, though more briefly and without running one in Tableau. For all these models, there are specific requirements that must be met for you to even be able to run them and obtain accurate results. This is why we have spent so much time considering how to choose the right model for the specific analysis you might be asked to run. We’ve collected all these considerations into a “Choosing A Model” checklist, included below, that you can use to help you decide what model to run for this week’s assignment.

The first consideration when choosing a model involves understanding that each type of model was designed to meet a specific purpose. So, the very first thing you want to do when choosing a model is to determine whether the purpose of a model matches the objective behind your analysis! For example, if you are asked for an estimate of what your company’s profits are projected to be over each of the next three months, a Time Series Analysis could be a good modeling technique for answering this question. That’s because Time Series Analysis models are designed for forecasting, i.e., predicting the value of some value (like profits) at future times (like each of the next three months).

After you’ve narrowed your choice of model according to purpose, you next have to consider variable requirements. For example, the variables you’re concerned with in the question given above are “Facebook Ad Conversions'' and “Facebook Ad Clicks.” You’ve learned how to characterize these variables by type (such as quantitative v. qualitative, and independent v. dependent). This information is important because each model requires variables of specific types. So, if you consult our checklist below, you can see that you need a quantitative independent variable and a quantitative dependent variable in order to run a Cluster Analysis.

Finally, once you’ve determined a model you’d like to run, based on purpose and variable requirements, you must look at your data to make sure it meets a set of certain assumptions. Your data must meet these assumptions in order to give you accurate results! For example, you might determine that Simple Linear Regression fits your analysis in terms of purpose and variable types, but does your distribution for these variables meet the “normality” assumption, under that model in the “Choose A Model” checklist? (Notice that much of the work that you’ve done in previous weeks of the Capstone project will help you determine whether your data meets such assumptions.) Refer again to this week’s readings and videos for a refresher on what all of these assumptions mean.

For your Week 4 Capstone question:


Refer to the “Choose A Model” checklist below and determine:

Which model’s purpose best addresses the question at hand.

Which model’s variable requirements are met by the question at hand.

Which model’s assumptions are met by the Capstone Dataset data.


In the Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 4, include the model you’ve selected and your reasoning behind that choice. If you’d like, you may download a PDF of this checklist here, fill it in, then paste an image of it into your slide deck.

2. Run Your Model
Now that you have determined the model that will best address your question, it’s time to run it!

In this week’s readings and videos, you learned how to use Tableau to run three of the model types described above: Simple Linear Regression, Cluster Analysis, Time Series Analysis. (Hint: one of these is the model that best addresses the question at hand.) We recommend that you use Tableau to run your model. However, if you have other tools to run your model, feel free to use those instead. But for this exercise, you are required to produce a visualization chart, similar to the one below, which shows the results of your analysis. You will need to take a screenshot of your visualization and paste it into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 4. As we’ve seen from this week’s discussions, Tableau is an excellent tool for producing such visualizations.

Here’s an example of the visualization we created in Tableau for a Time Series Analysis:
.![BgURC_v8S7KFEQv7_Euy-w_e63532870bb843578dc5379cd29d19f1_02---Model-Visualization-Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20629270/155965674-6439531a-2378-4c97-9200-233e40df7b89.png)


Your visualization chart should have a structure similar to this one. However, the above chart is just for example purposes. Unless you are using a Time Series Analysis model, your chart details are likely to vary significantly from this one. (Each model produces a distinct chart.)

Finally, remember that the purpose of running models is to be able to analyze specific results (such as predicting a value for a specific future date, or segmenting data to see the habits of a specific group, etc.). Once you have run your model for this week’s assignment, you should be able to read a specific result for Facebook Ad Conversions v. Facebook Ad Clicks directly from your visualization chart! Refer again to this week’s readings and videos for a refresher on how to do this.

For this second part of the Week 4 Capstone assignment, run the model you chose above for the Capstone Dataset data.

Produce the appropriate visualization chart for your results, and cut-and-paste a copy of it into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 4.

Using your chart, state what your model shows to be the expected number of Facebook Ad Conversions for a day of 50 Facebook Clicks.

Enter your results for these tasks into your Capstone Slide Deck slides for week 4
