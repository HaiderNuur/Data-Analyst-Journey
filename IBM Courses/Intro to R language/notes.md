- R was released in 1994 by Bell lab
- The meain reason to use R is to perform very comprehensive statistical computation tasks. 
- we can also use R to perform data sampling to obtain a representative data subset
- can also use R to analyze if variables are correlated, perform hypothesis testing and infer the properties of unknown distributions.
- also used in Data viz, perform interactive and visual analytics, predictive analysis, machine learning and AI tasks.
- statistical computation
- analyze the zip related data on an interactive map
