# Week two
- Data analysis dashboards provide key information in one place
- Dashboards can provide user interaction capabilities e.g. filters, slicers, timelines and map charts, Dashboard users get consolidated and visualized insight into their most important business and KPIs and also get a controllable self service BI interface. Dashboards are typically created in a data analysis application by using pivot tables and charts
- Pivot tables and charts could be created from a single data source or from multiple data sources
- Dashboards in a data analysis app: offer insights into your data, can alert you to trends and patterns, provide an interactive experience using filters, are dynamically updated as data changes, provide a centralized consolidated view of business data.
- it's useful in fiscal forecasting and reporting, project management, executive reporting, human resources, customer service, helpdesk issue tracking, healthcare monitoring, call center analytics, social media marketing and many more.
- Dash boards in basic spreadsheet apps: Excel, Google Sheets etc.
- Advanced data analysis and visualization apps: Bokeh, Dash in Python, R-studio's Shiny, Tableau, IBM cognos ANalytics

Before creating a Dashboard
- Collect and organize data
- verify your data is clean, error-free, has no blank rows or columns
- format your data as a table
- create pivot tables
- create several visualizations to populate your dashboard with (charts, maps, slicers etc)

Treemaps
- compare values acroos hierarchy levels
- show proportions as rectangles
- good way to display lots of data in one graphic
- color, size, and closeness of shapes represents hierarchical data categories

Scatter charts
- compare two sets of numerical data values
- show relationships between them
- combine two sets of "x" and "y" axis values into single data points
- displayed in clusters
- commonly used to compare statistical, scientific and engineering data values. 

Histograms
- show distribution of data grouped into "bins"
- look similiar to bar charts, but are very different
- bar charts compare data, while histograms display data distribution

Filled Map charts: suitable for data which contains geographical regions like countries, states, or postal codes.

Sparklines: suitable for showing data trends, such as seasonal increase-decrease, economic cycles, share rate or price fluctuations

Waterfall chart type: used to show cumulative effect of a series of positive and negative values. suitable for data which represents inflows and outflows like financial data.

Funnel chart type: used to show progressively smaller stages in a process.

Stock chart type: used to show the trend of stock's performance over time.

Surface chart type: used to show trends in values across two dimensions in 3-D surface or 2-D conteur charts, suitable when categories and data series are both numeric.

Radar chart type: used to show values relative to a center point, and most suitable when categories are not directly comparable.
