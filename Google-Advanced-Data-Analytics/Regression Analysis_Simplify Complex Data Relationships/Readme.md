# Project 1: Automatidata
In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.
Scenario: The relationship between fare amounts and payment type has been analyzed. The operations manager with New York City TLC is seeking more insight through regression modeling. The team’s next milestone is to run a regression model for taxi fares based on variables in the dataset.

**Tasks:**
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Create a regression model from the New York City TLC dataset
- Create an executive summary for the Automatidata data team sharing the results with the client.
# Project 2: TikTok 
The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

Scenario: The data team at TikTok is close to their goal of building a model to assist in the classification of claims in videos. The next step is to use the project data to create a regression model. As a member of TikTok’s data team, you'll determine the type of regression model that is needed and develop one using TikTok's claim classification data.

**Tasks**
- Import relevant packages and TikTok data
- Exploratory data analysis and check model assumptions
- Determine the correct modeling approach
- Build the regression model
- Finish checking model assumptions
- Evaluate the model
- Interpret model results and summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok
# Project 3: Waze
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

Scenario: Your team is more than halfway through their user churn project. Earlier you completed a project proposal, used Python to analyze and visualize Waze’s user data, and conducted a hypothesis test. As a next step, leadership asks your team to build a regression model to predict user churn based on a variety of variables. 

**Tasks**
- Check model assumptions
- Build a binomial regression model
- Evaluate the model
- Share an executive summary with the Waze leadership team
