# Projects Overview
**Goals: Build a dataframe for the datasets of every project, deeper standing of the data: Examine data type of each column and Gather descriptive statistics**

# Project 1: Automatidata
### Project goal: 
In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

### Background: 
Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

### Scenario:
The New York City TLC data is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python. You will need to clean, join, validate, and create a visualization for the taxi commission data. The findings will be shared with internal stakeholders from different departments within Automatidata.

### Course 3 tasks:
- Load data, explore, and extract the New York City TLC data with Python
- Use custom functions to organize the information within the New York City TLC dataset
- Build a dataframe for the New York City TLC project
- Create an executive summary for Automatidata for a general audience of internal professionals

# Project 2: TikTok 
### Project goal:
The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

### Background: 
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

### Scenario:
It is now time to begin the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA). As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, you will complete the EDA process for the claims classification project. You’ll also use Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.

### Tasks: 
- Imports of relevant packages and TikTok data into Python
- EDA and cleaning
- Assess Tableau measures and dimensions
- Select and build visualization(s) type
- Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables
- Share your results with the TikTok team

# Project 3: Waze
### Project goal:
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.
### Background: 
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 
### Scenario:
Your team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal, and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data. Now, the data is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. 

### Tasks: 
- Clean data
- Handle outliers
- Perform EDA
- Visualize data
- Share an executive summary with the Waze data team
