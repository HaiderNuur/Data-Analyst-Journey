- random forest
- XGBoost
- K-means

# Project 1: Automatidata
**Goal:** In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

**Background:** Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

**Scenario:** New York City TLC stakeholders have been impressed with the data analytical work completed by the Automatidata team in this project. As a result, they have reached out once again for assistance in creating a machine learning model that can help predict whether or not a rider will be a generous tipper.

**Tasks:**
- Build a random forest model from the New York City TLC dataset.
- Create an executive summary for the Automatidata data team before sharing the results with the client

# Project 2: TikTok 
**Goal:**  The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

**Background** TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

**Scenario:** The data team at TikTok is nearing the end of the claims classification project. The final milestone left for the team: creating the machine learning model. You will be responsible for leading these final tasks, which include feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. 

**Tasks**
- Import relevant packages and TikTok data.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Feature engineering.
- Check model assumptions.
- Model building.
- Model evaluation.
- Summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok.
  
# Project 3: Waze
**Goal:** Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

**Background:** Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer.

**Scenario** Your team is close to completing their user churn project. Previously, you completed a project proposal, used Python to analyze and visualize Waze’s user data, conducted a hypothesis test, and built a binomial logistic regression model. The final step is to build and test different machine learning models for predicting user churn. 

**Tasks**
-  Perform feature engineering.
-  Build the following machine learning models: random forest and XGBoost.
-  Evaluate the models
-  Share an executive summary with the Waze leadership team
