# Projects Overview
**Goals: use statistical methods such as hypothesis testing to analyze 3 workplace scenario datasets.**

# Project 1: Automatidata
### Project goal: 
is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.
### Background: 
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.

### Project tasks:
- Explore the project data
- Implement a hypothesis test
- Communicate insights with team members and TLC stakeholders

# Project 2: TikTok 
### Project goal:
The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform. The goal is to is to apply descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing in Python.

### Background: 
At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company, and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
### Scenario:
TikTok’s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:
- Explore the project data
- Implement a hypothesis test
- Communicate insights with stakeholders within TikTok
### Tasks: 
- Course 4 PACE Strategy Document to consider questions, details, and action items for each stage of the project scenario
- Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file
- Consider the different groups of data represented in the dataset
- Implement a hypothesis test
- Create an executive summary to share your results 

# Project 3: Waze
### Project goal:
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. The goal is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python.
### Background: 
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

Who are the users most likely to churn?

Why do users churn? 

When do users churn? 

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose these users without knowing why. 

Your insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.
### Tasks: 
- Explore the project data
- Implement a hypothesis test
- Communicate insights with stakeholders within Waze
