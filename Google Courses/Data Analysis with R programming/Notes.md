# Week One
- The term R is used to refer to both the programming language and the software that interprets the scripts written using it.

- RStudio is currently a very popular way to not only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.

**Benefits of RStudio** 
- RStudio is designed to make it easy to write scripts.
- RStudio makes it convenient to view and interact with the objects stored in your environment.
- RStudio makes it easy to set your working directory and access files on your computer.
- RStudio makes graphics much more accessible for a casual user

- CRAN: Comprehensive R Archive Network- An online archive with R packages, source code, manuals and documentation. 
- Packages are units of reproducible R code that you can use to add more functionality to R
- Packages can be found in repositories, which are collections of useful packages that are ready to install. You can find repositories on Bioconductor, R-Forge, rOpenSci, or GitHub, but the most commonly used repository is the Comprehensive R Archive Network or CRAN. CRAN stores code and documentation so that you can install packages into your own RStudio space. 
- Tidyverse: A system of packages in R with a common design philosophy for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.
- 8 core tidyverse packages: ggplot2, 
, tidyr, readr, purrr, dplyr, stringr, forcat

- A vignette is documentation that acts as a guide to an R package. A vignette shares details about the problem that the package is designed to solve and how the included functions can help you solve it. The browseVignettes function allows you to read through vignettes of a loaded package.
- Tidyverse was designed to improve the overall workflow for analysts. Since the packages are all integrated with each other, your analysis will be more efficient. You can use the browseVignettes function to find out more about each package and how to use it.
