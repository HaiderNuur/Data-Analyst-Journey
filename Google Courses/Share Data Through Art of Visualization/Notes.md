# Week One: Visualizing data
- you should split your time with data visuals in two ways:
- creating visuals using raw data to tell a story
- 4 key elements of successful visualization: information (data), story (concept), goal (function), visual form (metaphor)

## Design Data visualization
- The elements of art: line, shape, color, space, movement
- color can be described by their: hue (name), intensity and value
- when comparing between distinct objects (mobile vs desktop traffic): ordered bar, ordered column, grouped bar
- data composition: combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them together as a whole. 
- data composition (what percentage of our traffic comes from each platform): stacked bar, pie, donut, treemap, area
- show relationships(how has clicked increased with increased spend): scatterplot, bubble, column/line, heatmap
- elements for effective visuals: clear meaning, sophisticated use of contrast, refined execution

- design thinking: a process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way
- - Five phases of the design process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test
- Empathize: think about emotions and needs of your data viz, whether it's stakeholders, team members or public
- Define: helps you to find your audiences needs, their problems and your insights. which data to show
- Ideate: start to generate your data viz ideas. use all of your findings from empathize and define phases to brainstorm potential data viz solutions, involve creating  drafts of visualization with different color combinations or maybe experimenting with different shapes.

- ways to make data visualizations accessible: labeling, text alternatives,text-based formats, distinguishing, simplifying.
