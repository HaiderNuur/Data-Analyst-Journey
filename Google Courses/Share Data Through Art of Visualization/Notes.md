# Week One: Visualizing data
- you should split your time with data visuals in two ways:
- creating visuals using raw data to tell a story
- 4 key elements of successful visualization: information (data), story (concept), goal (function), visual form (metaphor)

## Design Data visualization
- The elements of art: line, shape, color, space, movement
- color can be described by their: hue (name), intensity and value
- when comparing between distinct objects (mobile vs desktop traffic): ordered bar, ordered column, grouped bar
- data composition: combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them together as a whole. 
- data composition (what percentage of our traffic comes from each platform): stacked bar, pie, donut, treemap, area
- show relationships(how has clicked increased with increased spend): scatterplot, bubble, column/line, heatmap
- elements for effective visuals: clear meaning, sophisticated use of contrast, refined execution
- **https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data/supplement/Z2Ox1/data-is-beautiful**
- design thinking: a process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way
- - Five phases of the design process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test
- Empathize: think about emotions and needs of your data viz, whether it's stakeholders, team members or public
- Define: helps you to find your audiences needs, their problems and your insights. which data to show
- Ideate: start to generate your data viz ideas. use all of your findings from empathize and define phases to brainstorm potential data viz solutions, involve creating  drafts of visualization with different color combinations or maybe experimenting with different shapes.

- ways to make data visualizations accessible: labeling, text alternatives,text-based formats, distinguishing, simplifying. 
 
# Week Two: Tableau
- Tableau: A business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data.
- **Create a HIGHLIGHT table/ HEAT MAP: https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm**
- **https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_howto_heatmap.htm**
- **VERY IMPORTANT: https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data/supplement/bDdpK/visualizations-in-spreadsheets-and-tableau**
- the first step to identifying appropriate visualizations is understanding what kind of data you are presenting, and that you should apply the four rules above to ensure the visualization has the biggest impact.
- After you understand the type of data (frequency, changes over time, categorical comparisons, etc.), then you must determine what your audience needs to see to understand your analysis. After that, find which graph or chart style fits your goal. Finally, utilize the visual design guidelines above to create an accessible and aesthetically pleasing data visualization.

# Week Three

#### 3 data storytelling steps
1. Engage your audience: Seek to capture the audience's attention on an intellectual and emotional level, identify your audience,  understand what internal stakeholders want from the project.
2. Create compelling visuals: Highlight the meaning behind the numbers at a glance, incorporate some interactive layered data so the curious can explore, visuals should be clear and able to stand on their own.
3. Tell the story in an interesting narrative: Clearly articulate recurring themes and data points, provide recommendations at the end.


- In tableau, tiled items can't be layered over other objects. They are part of a single-layered grid that automatically resizes based on the overall dashboard size. You can layer floating items over other objects.

- Filters in tableau can be used for: to customized information, to highlight a data point, to limit information


- Compelling presentation tips: Characters (stakeholders, customers, clients), setting (what's going on, how often it's happening, what tasks are involved, and other background), Plot (a new challenge needs to be fixed up, a new opportunity that the company just can't pass up), Big reveal (is how the data has shown that you can solve the problem by the characters are facing by becoming more competitive, improving a process, inventing a new system, or whatever the ultimate goal of your data project may be), Aha moment (when you share your recommendations and explain why you think they'll help your company be successful)
- The big reveal is how data solves the problem. Here, a timely marketing campaign could increase lumber sales
- Setting is what's happening and other background info.
- The Aha moment involves data-driven recommendations. 
- Characters are people affected by your story. 
- Plot creates tension in the situation.

# Week Four
- The frameword of your presentation starts with your understanding of the business task
- When creating a presentation to share with stakeholders, what is the purpose of a framework: Create logical connections that tie back to the business task, help you focus on the most important information, give your audience context to better understand your data.
- **https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data/lecture/P0cIP/weaving-data-into-your-presentation
- The McCandless Method: Introduce the graphic by name, answer obvious questions before they're asked, state the insight of your graphic, call out data to support that insight, tell your audience why it matters

## Presentations tips
- Two key responsibilities of a data analyst: Analyze the data, Present your findings effectively
- Channel your excitement, start with broader ideas, use 5 second rule (wait 5 sec after showing a data visualization, ask if they understand, give your audience another 5 sec, tell them the conclusion), Preparation is key.
