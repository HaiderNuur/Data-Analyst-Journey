The six data analysis Phases:
Ask
Things to consider:
• Define the problem you’re trying to solve, 
• Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations, 
• Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions, 
• Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication 
• Take a step back and see the whole situation in context 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
• What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
• Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?
Prepare 
You need to decide what data you need to collect to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it's useful. You might use your business task to decide: 
• What metrics to measure
• Locate data in your database
• Create security measures to protect that data 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
• What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
• What research do I need to do?
Process 
Clean your data to get rid of errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. 
• Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
• Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
• Removing repeated entries
• Checking as much as possible for bias in the data 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
• What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve? 

• How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?
Analyze
Sort and format your data to make it easier to
• Perform calculations
• Combine data from multiple sources
• Create tables with your results 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
• What story is my data telling me?
• How will my data help me solve this problem?
• Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?
Share 
Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis with data viz tools like dashboard or graphs.  This is the chance to show your stakeholders you solved the problem and how you got there. Sharing will help your team to
• Make better decisions
• Make more informed decisions
• Lead to stronger outcomes
• Successfully communicate your findings 

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 

• How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
• What would help me understand this if I were the listener? 

Act
Provide your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so that they can make data driven decisions. 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
• How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

Grouping data based on common features 
3. Spotting something unusual 
Identifying data that is different from the norm. 
4. Identifying themes
Recognizing broader concepts and trends from categorized data.
5. Discovering connections 
Identifying similar challenges across different entities—and using data and insights to find common solutions.
6. Finding patterns 
Using historical data about what happened in the past to understand how likely it is to happen again.
