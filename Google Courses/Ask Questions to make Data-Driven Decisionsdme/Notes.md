###### The six data analysis Phases:

1. Ask

Things to consider:
- Define the problem you’re trying to solve, 
- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations, 
- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions, 
- collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication 
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
- What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
- Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

2. Prepare 

You need to decide what data you need to collect to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it's useful. You might use your business task to decide: 
- What metrics to measure
- Locate data in your database
- Create security measures to protect that data 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
- What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
- What research do I need to do?

3. Process 

Clean your data to get rid of errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. 
- Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
- Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
- Removing repeated entries
- Checking as much as possible for bias in the data 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
- What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve? 
- How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

4. Analyze
Sort and format your data to make it easier to

- Perform calculations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Create tables with your results 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
- What story is my data telling me?
- How will my data help me solve this problem?
- Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

5. Share 

Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis with data viz tools like dashboard or graphs.  This is the chance to show your stakeholders you solved the problem and how you got there. Sharing will help your team to
  - Make better decisions
  - Make more informed decisions
  - Lead to stronger outcomes
  - Successfully communicate your findings 

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
- How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
- What would help me understand this if I were the listener? 

6. Act

Provide your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so that they can make data driven decisions. 

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
  - How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

Data analysts typically work with the six problem types:
  1. Making predictions 
      Using data to make informed decisions about how things may be in the future. 
  2. Categorizing things 
      Grouping data based on common features 
  3. Spotting something unusual 
      Identifying data that is different from the norm. 
  4. Identifying themes
      Recognizing broader concepts and trends from categorized data.
  5. Discovering connections 
      Identifying similar challenges across different entities—and using data and insights to find common solutions.
  6. Finding patterns 
      Using historical data about what happened in the past to understand how likely it is to happen again.

SMART questions: 

Specific: 
- is the question specific?
- Does it address the problem? 
- Does it have a context.?
- Will it uncover a lot of Information you need? 

Measurable 
  - Will the question give you answers that you can measure? 

Action-oriented 
  - Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of action plan? 

Related 
  - Is the question about the particular problem that you are trying to solve? 

Time-bound 
  - Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

# Week two: data driven decisions 
- Qualitative data tools: Focus groups,  social media text analysis, in-person interviews 
- Quantitative data tools: Structured interviews, surveys, polls 
- Metric: a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. 
- ROI or return on investment is a metrics that let a business know how an investment is doing. 
- As a refresher, a dashboard is a single point of access for managing a business's information. It allows analysts to pull key information from data in a quick review by visualizing the data in a way that makes findings easy to understand. 
- Three categories of Dashboards: Strategic, Operational, Analytical
- Strategic: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics
- Operational: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals
- Analytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets
- Similarities: Dashboards are visualizations: Visualizing data can be enormously useful for understanding and demonstrating what the data really means.  Dashboards identify metrics: Relevant metrics may help analysts assess company performance.
- Some differences include the timeframe described in each dashboard.  The operational dashboard has a timeframe of days and weeks, while the strategic dashboard displays the entire year. The analytic dashboard skips a specific timeframe. Instead, it identifies and tracks the various KPIs that may be used to assess strategic and operational goals.
- Dashboards can help companies perform many helpful tasks, such as: Track historical and current performance, Establish both long-term and/or short-term goals, Define key performance indicators or metrics, Identify potential issues or points of inefficiency.
- While almost every company can benefit in some way from using a dashboard, larger companies and companies with a wider range of products or services will likely benefit more. Companies operating in volatile, or swiftly changing markets like marketing, sales, and tech also tend to more quickly gain insights and make data-informed decisions.
