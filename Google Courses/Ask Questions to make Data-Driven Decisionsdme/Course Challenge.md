# 1.Scenario 1, questions 1-5

You’ve just started a job as a data analyst at a small software company that provides data analytics and business intelligence solutions. Your supervisor asks you to kick off a project with a new client, Athena’s Story, a feminist bookstore. They have four existing locations, and the fifth shop has just opened in your community.

Athena’s Story wants to produce a campaign to generate excitement for an upcoming celebration and introduce the bookstore to the community. They share some data with your team to help make the event as successful as possible.

Your task is to review the assignment and the available data, then present your approach to your supervisor. Click the link below to access the email from your supervisor:

Question 1
After reading the email, you notice that the acronym WHM appears in multiple places. You look it up online, and the most common result is web host manager. That doesn’t seem right to you, as it doesn’t fit the context of a feminist bookstore. Still, you should assume it’s correct and continue with the project.

###### Answer: False

2.
###### Question 2
Scenario 1 continued
Now that you know WHM stands for Women’s History Month, you continue reviewing the datasets. You notice that the Customer Survey dataset contains both qualitative and quantitative data.
The qualitative data includes information from which columns? Select all that apply.

###### Answer: Column B, E, F

3.
###### Question 3
Scenario 1 continued
Next, you review the customer feedback in column F of the Customer Survey dataset. 
The attribute of column F is, “Survey Q6: What types of books would you like to see more of at Athena's Story?” In order to verify that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most popular genres, you create a visualization. This will help you clearly identify which genres are most likely to sell well during the Women’s History Month campaign. 
Fill in the blank: The visualization you create demonstrates the percentages of each book genre that make up the total number of survey responses. It’s called a _____ chart.
###### Answer: piechart

###### Question 4
Now that you’ve confirmed that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most requested book genres, you review the Historical Sales dataset.
You’re pleased to see that the dataset contains data that’s specific to children’s literature and feminist zines. This will provide you with the information you need to make data-inspired decisions. In addition, the children’s literature and feminist zines metrics will help you organize and analyze the data about each genre in order to determine if they’re likely to be profitable.
Next, you calculate the total sales over 52 weeks for feminist zines. You type =CALCULATE(E2-E53) but get an error. What is the correct syntax? 

##### Answer: =SUM(E2:E53)

5.
###### Question 5
Scenario 1 continued
After familiarizing yourself with the project and available data, you present your approach to your supervisor. You provide a scope of work, which includes important details, a schedule, and information on how you plan to prepare and validate the data. You also share some of your initial results and the pie chart you created. 
In addition, you identify the problem type, or domain, for the data analysis project. You decide that the historical sales data can be used to provide insights into the types of books that will sell best during Women’s History Month this coming year. This will also enable you to determine if Athena’s Story should begin selling more children’s literature and feminist zines.
Using historical data to make informed decisions about how things may be in the future is an example of discovering connections.
###### Answer: False
