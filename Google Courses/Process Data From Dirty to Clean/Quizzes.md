# Week 1
### Data integrity and analytics objectives
- Which of the following principles are key elements of data integrity? Select all that apply.
> Accuracy, Consistency, trustworthyness
- Which process do data analysts use to make data more organized and easier to read?
> Data manipulation
- Before analysis, a company collects data from countries that use different date formats. Which of the following updates would improve the data integrity?
> Change all of the dates to the same format
### Dealing with insufficient data
- Why are pre-cleaning steps important to complete prior to data cleaning?
> If you know that your data is accurate, consistent, and complete, you can be confident that your results will be valid. Stakeholders will be pleased if you connect the data to business objectives. And, knowing when to stop collecting data will allow you to finish your tasks in a timely manner without sacrificing data integrity.
- What problems might occur if you don't follow these steps? 
> Suppose that you didn't determine data integrity. You may find that you are working with inaccurate or missing data, which can cause misleading results in your analysis. If you don’t connect objectives with the data, your analysis may not be relevant to the stakeholders. Finally, not understanding when to stop collecting data can lead to unnecessary delays in completing tasks. By completing pre-cleaning activities, you avoid these problems.
- What should an analyst do if they do not have the data needed to meet a business objective? Select all that apply.
> Gather related data on a small scale and request additional time to find more complete data, Perform the analysis by finding and using proxy data from other datasets. 
- Which of the following are limitations that might lead to insufficient data? Select all that apply.
> Outdated data, Data that updates continually, Data from a single source 
- A data analyst wants to find out how many people in Utah have swimming pools. It’s unlikely that they can survey every Utah resident. Instead, they survey enough people to be representative of the population. This describes what data analytics concept?
> Sample
### Testing your data
- A research team runs an experiment to determine if a new security system is more effective than the previous version. What type of results are required for the experiment to be statistically significant?
> Results that are real and not caused by random chance 
- In order to have a high confidence level in a customer survey, what should the sample size accurately reflect?
> The entire population
- A data analyst determines an appropriate sample size for a survey. They can check their work by making sure the confidence level percentage plus the margin of error percentage add up to 100%.
> False (The confidence level percentage and margin of error percentage do not have to add up to 100%. They are independent of each other)
### Margin of error
- Fill in the blank: Margin of error is the _____ amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population. 
> Maximum
- In a survey about a new cleaning product, 75% of respondents report they would buy the product again. The margin of error for the survey is 5%. Based on the margin of error, what percentage range reflects the population's true response? 
> Minimum

## Weekly Challenge 1
- Which of the following conditions are necessary to ensure data integrity? Select all that apply.
> Completeness, accuracy
- A financial analyst imports a dataset to their computer from a storage device. As it’s being imported, the connection is interrupted, which compromises the data. Which of the following processes caused the compromise?
> Data transfer
- A data analyst is given a dataset for analysis. It includes data about the total population of every country in the previous 20 years. Which of the following questions can the analyst use this dataset to address? Select all that apply.
> What was the difference in population between two specific countries in 2018?, What was the average population of a certain country from 2015 through 2020?

> False
- A data analyst at a software company wants to learn more about industry competitors. Because the software industry has more mergers than any other field, the companies and their products are constantly evolving. The analyst has a dataset from three years ago, and they notice that many of the companies and products in the dataset have changed. What makes the analyst decide that the data is insufficient, so they should generate fresh data instead?
