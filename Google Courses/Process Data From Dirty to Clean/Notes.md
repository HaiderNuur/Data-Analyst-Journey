# Week 1
### Data integrity and analytics
- Data integrity: the accuracy, completeness, consistency and trustworthiness of data
- Data manipulation: the process of changing data to make it more organised and easier to read 
- Clean data + alignment to business objectives = accurate conclusions
- Data (integrity) can be compromised when: replicated, transferred, or manipulated 
- Other ways it can be compromised: human error, viruses, malware, hacking and system failure
### Dealing with insufficient data
- Types of Insufficient data: data from only one source, data that keeps updating, outdated data, geographically-limited data
- Ways to address insufficient data: identify trends with the available data, wait for more data if time allows, talk with stakeholders and adjust your objective. 
- Margin of Error: Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. This difference is called the margin of error. The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. 
- Confidence level: How confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study. 
- Confidence interval: The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.

Things to remember when determining the size of your sample
- Don’t use a sample size less than 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where an average result of a sample starts to represent the average result of a population.
- The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases. 
- Increase the sample size to meet specific needs of your project:
- For a higher confidence level, use a larger sample size
- To decrease the margin of error, use a larger sample size
- For greater statistical significance, use a larger sample size
